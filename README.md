# libstorage

libstorage provides C and C++ storage structures adapted from open source
projects.

## Goals

* All structures included in libstorage should licensed under liberal terms allowing
use and modification for any purpose.
* Structures should be self contained. e.g. a single header
* Structures should be easy to link in an isolated fashion.
